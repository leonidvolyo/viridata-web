# ✅ Deployment Fix Applied

## What Was Wrong:
1. ❌ Workflow tried to use npm (project uses yarn)
2. ❌ date-fns version incompatibility (v4 vs required v2-3)

## What I Fixed:
1. ✅ Updated workflow to use yarn properly
2. ✅ Downgraded date-fns from 4.1.0 to 3.6.0 (compatible with react-day-picker)
3. ✅ Added yarn caching for faster builds
4. ✅ Simplified workflow with proper working-directory

## 🚀 Deploy Now:

```bash
cd /app
git add .
git commit -m "Fix deployment workflow and dependencies"
git push origin main
```

Or use the script:
```bash
cd /app
./deploy.sh
```

## ✅ Expected Result:

- Build will complete successfully
- No dependency errors
- Site deployed to: https://leonidvolyo.github.io/viridata-web/
- Takes 2-3 minutes
