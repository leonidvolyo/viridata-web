## 🔧 What Was Wrong Before:

1. ❌ No `.env.production` file
2. ❌ PUBLIC_URL not set in build workflow
3. ❌ Build was using relative paths instead of absolute paths

## ✅ What's Fixed Now:

1. ✓ Created `.env.production` with PUBLIC_URL
2. ✓ Updated workflow to set PUBLIC_URL during build
3. ✓ Build now generates correct absolute paths for all assets
